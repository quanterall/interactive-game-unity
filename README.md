# Interactive Game for Unity

## Introduction

The goal of this very simple game (courtesy of Quanterall Ltd.) is to demonstrate different kinds of user control. Along with the standard keyboard control, it allows voice commands. The plan is to add gesture control, as well.

Here are the voice commands you can use to control the player:
* GO - start moving
* STOP - stop moving
* JUMP - jump :)

If you fall off the platform, the game will start over again.
